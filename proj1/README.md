## Installation problems
During the installation process of the project WolfTrack 3.0, we encountered several challenges that made the experience notably challenging. Firstly, we faced difficulties related to dependency management. Managing dependencies within a virtual environment was unfamiliar terrain, and we often encountered errors such as "ModuleNotFoundError" when trying to import essential libraries like Flask and Flask-RESTful. These issues resulted from not having all the required packages installed in my virtual environment, which could have been avoided by maintaining a comprehensive requirements.txt file from the start. This file would have listed all project dependencies, making it easier to install them collectively and avoid version conflicts.

Furthermore, we ran into problems with compatibility, particularly when trying to use specific versions of libraries like scikit-learn. It was frustrating to encounter "No matching distribution found" errors, emphasizing the need to thoroughly research compatibility between Python versions and package versions. Clear documentation, community forums, or consulting project README files for compatibility notes would have been helpful in avoiding these roadblocks.

Lastly, we faced an unexpected issue when dealing with SSL certificate errors during NLTK stopwords download. Although this was documented in the README file but could have been made more clear. 


## Documentation problems
The documentation could benefit from more detailed information on configuring the application. For example, it should include instructions on setting up database connections, AWS integration, and other essential configurations. Clear examples and code snippets can be invaluable for developers trying to configure the system correctly.

While the documentation briefly mentions the application's features, it lacks detailed usage examples. Providing examples of how to use various features, such as resume parsing and job recommendation, can help developers understand how to leverage the functionality effectively.
 
The section on running the application in Docker is present, but it could be more comprehensive. Clearer steps, explanations of the Dockerfile, and guidance on image deployment and tagging would be beneficial for developers interested in containerization.

 While there is a link to contributing guidelines, it would be helpful to provide clear information on how to contribute, submit bug reports, and engage with the project's development community

## About the demo video
Regarding the demo video, while it was well-produced and provided a good overview of the project's functionalities, it missed an opportunity to engage potential contributors. To make the video more enticing for individuals interested in contributing to the project, it could include segments highlighting the project's impact, its potential for growth, and the exciting challenges that contributors could tackle.
